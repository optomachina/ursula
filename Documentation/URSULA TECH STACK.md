Frontend
•	Primary Framework: React (or Vue/Angular if EO has a preferred alternative)
o	Reason: Rapid development, component-based structure, large ecosystem.
•	UI Components/Libraries:
o	Material UI or Bootstrap for quick, standardized styling.
o	D3.js or Chart.js for charts and data visualizations.
•	Key Considerations:
o	File upload functionality (drag-and-drop library, e.g., react-dropzone).
o	Role-based UI if the project extends to different EO departments.

Backend
•	Language/Framework:
o	Node.js + Express (fast prototyping, easy JSON handling)
OR
o	Python + Flask (more direct synergy with Python-based NLP tools)
•	Key Endpoints:
o	File Upload: Endpoint to handle ingestion (multipart/form-data).
o	NLP Processing: Endpoint or microservice that triggers AI routines.
o	Data Retrieval: APIs for dashboards, reports, and insights.
•	Security:
o	HTTPS/TLS for secure data transfer.
o	Authentication (SSO if available, or JWT-based session tokens).

AI/NLP Layer
•	Core Libraries:
o	Python (preferred):
	spaCy for lightweight entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging.
	Transformers (Hugging Face) for more advanced text classification or Q&A tasks.
o	Models:
	Pre-trained English language models (e.g., en_core_web_md for spaCy).
	Additional domain-specific fine-tuning if EO’s text data demands it.
•	Capabilities:
o	Question vs. Answer Detection: Custom classifier to separate Q&A segments.
o	Keyword Extraction: spaCy’s entity recognition or keyword extraction pipeline for product names.
o	Sentiment Analysis: Transformers-based sentiment classification or a simpler rule-based approach to start.
•	Deployment:
o	Could run alongside the backend or as a separate container/microservice for scalability.

Database & Storage
•	Recommended Databases:
o	PostgreSQL for structured data (e.g., user management, metadata about uploads).
o	MongoDB if we want flexible document storage (raw transcripts and tags).
•	Schema Design:
o	Raw Data Table/Collection: Store original text, file references.
o	Processed Data: Tags, extracted entities, sentiment scores.
o	Users & Permissions: Track roles, access levels.
•	Hosting Considerations:
o	If self-hosting: Setup DB on EO’s internal infrastructure with proper backups.
o	If cloud: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) or Atlas (MongoDB).

Infrastructure & Deployment
•	Hosting:
o	EO Internal Servers or Secure Cloud (AWS, GCP) as needed.
o	For MVP, a basic VM or container environment often suffices.
•	Containerization:
o	Docker for packaging the backend and NLP services.
o	Docker Compose/Kubernetes if we need more robust orchestration.
•	CI/CD:
o	Git-based workflow with automated testing (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
o	Automatic deployments to staging/production for continuous updates.
•	Logging & Monitoring:
o	ELK Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana/Prometheus for system metrics.
o	Helps catch ingestion issues and NLP bottlenecks early.

Integrations & Future Options
•	CRM/Ticketing:
o	API connections to existing EO platforms for direct syncing of parsed insights.
o	Consider webhook-based event triggers for real-time updates.
•	Single Sign-On (SSO):
o	Leverage EO’s existing SSO provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) for user authentication.
o	Simplifies user management at scale.
•	Advanced NLP:
o	Domain-specific models trained on EO’s historical data.
o	Potential for topic modeling, advanced entity recognition, or multi-lingual support.
