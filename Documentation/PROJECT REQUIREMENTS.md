Must-Haves (M)
•	Unified Data Ingestion
Single upload point for emails, chat logs, call transcripts. Essential for gathering feedback in one place.
•	Automated Tagging & Categorization
Ability to separate questions vs. answers, plus basic keyword/topic extraction.
•	Basic Sentiment & Trend Analysis
At least a simple sentiment score to gauge positivity/negativity and detect high-level trends.
•	Search & Filtering
Must be able to look up data by keyword/product category and filter out noise.
•	Actionable Insights & Reporting
Core dashboards: frequent questions, top pain points, emerging trends.
•	Basic User-Friendly Interface
Simple web UI for easy upload, minimal training, straightforward dashboards.
•	Basic Security & Access Controls
User authentication and role-based permissions so data stays protected.
•	Core Backend & NLP
Foundational Node.js/Python server to handle file uploads, parsing, and NLP tasks.
•	Database & Storage
A reliable database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MongoDB) to store raw and processed feedback.
Should-Haves (S)
•	Enhanced Sentiment & Trend Analysis
More nuanced scoring and deeper trend detection (e.g., per product line).
•	Advanced Filtering
Filters by sentiment level, date ranges, or custom tags.
•	Role-Based Dashboards
Different views for Sales vs. Engineering, etc.
•	Single Sign-On (SSO)
If EO already uses SSO, integrating it would improve user management.
•	Logging & Monitoring
Better error handling, performance tracking, system health alerts.
Could-Haves (C)
•	Further Integrations
Automated syncing to CRM/ticketing systems or analytics/BI dashboards.
•	Microservices Architecture
Asynchronous NLP tasks for large-scale data if system load becomes high.
•	Advanced Reporting
Automated PDF/Excel exports, scheduled email reports.
•	Deep NLP
More sophisticated named-entity recognition and product mapping with custom models.
•	Containerized Deployment (Docker)
Nice for portability and scaling, but not critical in an initial MVP if simpler deployment works.
Won’t-Have (W) — At Least Not Yet
•	Highly Custom AI Models
(e.g., specialized or domain-trained models beyond basic Q&A and sentiment)
•	Fully Automated CRM Integrations
(Decent to plan for, but not crucial for a first launch)
