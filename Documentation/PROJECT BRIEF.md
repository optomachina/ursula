Project Name: URSULA
Universal Resource for Speech, Understanding, and Linguistic Analysis
Context: An internal Edmund Optics (EO) initiative to streamline customer feedback parsing.
Overview
URSULA is our in-house MVP web app designed to help Edmund Optics collect and parse textual customer interactions—emails, support chats, call transcripts—and transform them into structured insights. It automatically extracts question-answer pairs, flags recurring problems, and highlights what customers really need or want.
Goals & Objectives
1.	Consolidate Feedback: Provide a single place for internal teams to upload and analyze customer interactions.
2.	Streamline Insight Extraction: Use AI to detect product requests, common issues, and opportunities for new optics solutions.
3.	Improve Decision-Making: Offer clear metrics on product performance, unmet customer needs, and “Voice of Customer” sentiments.
4.	Ease of Use: Ensure straightforward uploads, minimal training, and a simple dashboard for easy consumption by various teams (Sales, Engineering, Marketing).
Problem Statement
We currently juggle numerous channels—emails, calls, and chat logs—but struggle to unify them into actionable insights. Manual tagging is time-consuming, and there’s no central hub to quickly gauge what customers want across product lines. URSULA aims to cut through this noise and give us a real-time, organized view of the feedback we receive.
Scope & Key Features
•	Data Ingestion: Single interface for uploading emails, live chat logs, and call transcripts from internal systems.
•	Automatic Tagging: AI model recognizes questions, answers, and specific keywords related to EO’s product categories (e.g., Laser Optics, Imaging Lenses).
•	Actionable Insights: Quickly locate top user questions, common issues, and potential new product requests.
•	Product Category Mapping: System flags relevant EO product categories for better cross-team communication.
•	Reporting & Dashboards: Summaries of recurring themes, sentiment analysis, and upcoming product demands.
Technology Stack
•	Frontend: React or a similar JS framework for user-friendly interfaces.
•	Backend: Node.js/Express or Python Flask, depending on existing EO infrastructure preferences.
•	AI/NLP: Python-based (spaCy or Transformers) for robust language processing.
•	Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store raw and processed feedback data.
•	Hosting: Edmund Optics internal servers or a secure cloud instance (AWS/GCP/Snowflake) for scalability.
Timeline & Milestones
1.	Weeks 1-2: Finalize requirements with Sales, Customer Support, and Engineering.
2.	Weeks 3-4: Implement backend architecture and database schemas.
3.	Weeks 5-6: Build a simple frontend MVP for file uploads and initial reporting.
4.	Weeks 7-8: Enhance NLP capabilities: question-answer detection, product tagging.
5.	Weeks 9-10: Internal testing, bug fixes, and feedback loop with key stakeholders.
6.	Week 11: Soft launch within EO; gather user insights for the next iteration. 
Success Metrics
•	Adoption Rate: Number of EO teams actively using URSULA (e.g., Support, Sales).
•	Parsing Accuracy: Percentage of correctly extracted Q&A pairs, product tags, and feedback labels.
•	Time Savings: Reduction in manual tagging and analysis hours.
•	Feedback Depth: How often URSULA surfaces new or critical product insights (e.g., unaddressed product requests).
Next Steps
•	Run a pilot with a limited user group (e.g., Customer Support team).
•	Incorporate feedback into refining NLP models and user interface.
•	Expand to other departments (Sales, Marketing) for broader insights.
•	Explore integrating URSULA data directly into existing EO CRMs or ticketing systems.
End Goal: Create a scalable, internal Edmund Optics tool that centralizes customer communications, automatically highlights key insights, and empowers us to respond more quickly to evolving market needs.
