Technical Requirements
1.	Frontend
•	Framework: React (or similar) for a fast, interactive user experience.
•	Key Components:
•	Upload Form (drag-and-drop or file selector)
•	Real-Time Dashboard (charts, tables, sentiment visuals)
•	Filter/Search UI
2.	Backend
•	Framework: Node.js/Express or Python Flask, depending on EO’s existing ecosystem.
•	API Endpoints:
•	File handling (uploads, parsing)
•	NLP processing requests (tagging, sentiment analysis)
•	Reporting/analytics endpoints
3.	NLP/AI Layer
•	Language Processing: Python-based (spaCy or Transformers).
•	Core Models:
•	Q&A detection (classify question vs. answer sections)
•	Named-entity recognition (flagging product names/categories)
•	Sentiment analysis (scoring + labeling)
•	Data Pipelines: A queue or microservice architecture for asynchronous NLP tasks if needed.
4.	Database & Storage
•	Choice: PostgreSQL for relational data or MongoDB for more flexible document storage.
•	Schemas/Collections:
•	Raw data (stored as JSON blobs or structured transcripts)
•	Processed tags (Q&A pairs, product references, sentiment scores)
•	User/Access control tables
5.	Infrastructure & Deployment
•	Hosting:
•	Internal EO servers or secure cloud instance (AWS/GCP).
•	Scalability:
•	Containerized deployment (Docker) for easy scaling.
•	CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and updates.
6.	Security & Compliance
•	Authentication:
•	Single Sign-On or OAuth-based approach for internal users.
•	Data Handling:
•	Encrypted storage and data in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
•	Access Controls:
•	Granular role-based permissions.
7.	Logging & Monitoring
•	Application Logs: Track errors, NLP processing, and user activity.
•	Monitoring Tools: Set up alerts for system performance, ingestion failures, or high error rates.
8.	Future Integrations
•	CRM Linking: Sync parsed insights directly to existing EO CRMs or ticketing systems.
•	Analytics & BI Tools: Provide data exports or APIs to feed into corporate dashboards.
