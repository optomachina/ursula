1. Access & Authentication
1.	Login
a.	User navigates to the URSULA web app.
b.	They log in using their Edmund Optics credentials (SSO if enabled, or standard username/password).
c.	Once authenticated, they are taken to the main dashboard.
2.	Role-Based Landing
a.	Depending on the user’s role (e.g., Sales, Support, Engineering), they may see a tailored dashboard or the same MVP interface (depending on the project phase).

2. Data Ingestion & Upload
1.	Upload Interface
a.	On the main dashboard, there is a prominent button or drag-and-drop area for uploading files.
b.	Users can upload emails in PDF/HTML/text, chat logs, and call transcripts in text format.
2.	File Handling & Parsing
a.	Once a file is dropped or selected, URSULA begins parsing the file’s text.
b.	Basic checks occur (e.g., file format, size limits).
c.	A progress bar or status indicator informs the user that the system is “Reading...” or “Processing...”
3.	Success/Failure Notifications
a.	If parsing succeeds, the user sees a confirmation: “File successfully uploaded and queued for analysis.”
b.	If an error occurs (file too large, wrong file type, etc.), the user is prompted to correct or retry.

3. Automated Analysis
1.	AI/NLP Processing
a.	Behind the scenes, URSULA’s NLP engine (spaCy/Transformers) identifies:
i.	Question vs. Answer segments
ii.	Keywords (product categories, product names, etc.)
iii.	Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
iv.	Recurring Trends (patterns across many files)
2.	Tagging & Categorization
a.	URSULA tags each piece of text with relevant product categories (e.g., Laser Optics, Imaging Lenses).
b.	User’s upload data moves from “Raw” storage to “Processed” storage in the database with tags & metadata.
3.	Notifications/Alerts
a.	If the data triggers certain thresholds (e.g., multiple mentions of the same high-impact issue), URSULA can highlight it for further review.
b.	Users may receive a quick alert on the dashboard: “Recurring complaint detected: X product line.”

4. Dashboard & Visualization
1.	Dashboard Overview
a.	After processing completes, the user sees top-level metrics for their uploads:
i.	Most frequent product requests
ii.	Sentiment distribution (e.g., 60% positive, 30% neutral, 10% negative)
iii.	Top recurring issues
iv.	Recent Q&A pairs
2.	Filtering & Search
a.	Users can filter by date range, product category, sentiment, or custom tags.
b.	A search bar allows quick keyword lookups (e.g., “coating damage,” “custom lens request”).
3.	Details & Drill-Down
a.	Clicking on any dashboard element (like a bar in a chart) narrows down to the underlying text snippets or transcripts that contributed to that data point.
b.	Users see question-answer pairs, sentiment scores, and product tags in context.

5. Reviewing & Editing Tags (If Needed)
1.	Manual Review
a.	In some cases, advanced users or administrators may want to confirm or correct automatically assigned tags.
b.	The user can edit tags, correct product mappings, or mark certain text sections as irrelevant.
2.	Feedback Loop to the AI
a.	If the system’s tagging is incorrect, user corrections can feed back into the model for improved accuracy over time (future iteration).

6. Generating Insights & Reports
1.	Actionable Insights
a.	The “Insights” tab aggregates frequent questions, top pain points, trending product requests, and sentiment over time.
b.	Team members can quickly see if a certain lens or coating is generating consistent negative feedback or new requests.
2.	Report Exports
a.	Users can export findings to PDF, CSV, or Excel for sharing with other EO teams.
b.	Automated or scheduled reports may be configured (if enabled in a later phase).
3.	Cross-Team Collaboration
a.	Insights can be shared by sending direct links or by generating shareable summaries (depending on role-based permissions).
b.	Relevant product managers or engineering leads can be notified to check trending issues.

7. Ongoing Management & Administration
1.	User Management
a.	Admins can add new users, assign roles (Sales, Engineering, etc.), and set permissions for who can see or edit data.
2.	Monitoring & Maintenance
a.	System admins check logs and performance dashboards (e.g., ingestion errors, NLP processing times).
b.	If advanced monitoring is in place, they receive alerts for downtime or high error rates.
3.	Scaling & Future Integrations
a.	As usage grows, the team may opt to containerize the app or integrate it with existing CRMs or ticketing systems to automatically sync parsed insights.

8. Iteration & Feedback
1.	User Feedback Loop
a.	Teams using URSULA provide feedback on UI, tagging accuracy, and missing features.
b.	Product owners prioritize improvements (e.g., advanced search, more granular sentiment analysis).
2.	Future Enhancements
a.	Deeper NLP (custom domain models).
b.	Fully automated CRM or ticketing system integrations.
c.	Role-specific dashboards and single sign-on (SSO) for streamlined logins.
3.	Continuous Improvement
a.	Regular updates are released, refining the AI models and introducing new capabilities to enhance user experience and insight depth.

Conclusion
This flow outlines how internal Edmund Optics users move through URSULA—from logging in and uploading raw text data, to seeing immediate, AI-driven insights and generating useful reports. Over time, feedback from real users will shape a more refined, integrated, and powerful version of URSULA that seamlessly feeds the “voice of the customer” into every part of the organization.
