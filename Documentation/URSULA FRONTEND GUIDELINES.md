1. Design System & UI Framework
•	Chosen UI Library: shadcn(or Bootstrap or Material UI)
o	Reason: Rapid prototyping, consistent styling, built-in components.
•	Reusable Components: Create a library of common UI elements (buttons, modals, alerts) that all teams can use.
o	These components should handle styling, layout, and accessibility defaults.

2. Branding & Visual Consistency
1.	Color Palette
a.	Primary Color: EO-branded color (e.g., a specific shade of blue or green).
b.	Secondary Color: Contrasting color for accents, highlights, or call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
c.	Neutrals: Grayscale shades for backgrounds, borders, and text.
d.	Usage:
i.	Primary color for headers, important buttons, or key highlights.
ii.	Secondary color for less critical buttons or to draw attention to secondary features.
iii.	Neutrals for backgrounds and text to maintain readability.
2.	Typography
a.	Font Family: A standard, widely available web-safe font or a corporate typeface if EO has one.
b.	Hierarchy:
i.	H1 for page titles.
ii.	H2 for section headings.
iii.	H3/H4 for sub-sections.
iv.	Body for regular text, paragraphs, and instructions.
c.	Font Sizes: Use responsive scaling (e.g., rem units) to ensure readability on all screens.
3.	Iconography
a.	Stick to a consistent icon set (e.g., Material Icons or FontAwesome).
b.	Use icons to reinforce meaning, not just for decoration.
c.	Keep icons minimal and aligned with the overall design style.

3. Layout & Spacing
1.	Grid System
a.	If using Material UI, leverage the built-in grid system. Otherwise, consider a 12-column responsive layout.
2.	Consistent Spacing
a.	Use standard spacing increments (e.g., multiples of 4px or 8px) for margins and paddings.
b.	Maintain uniform spacing between elements (e.g., all cards have the same padding).
3.	Responsive Breakpoints
a.	The app must be usable on various screen sizes (laptop, large monitor, tablet, potentially mobile).
b.	Ensure key workflows (e.g., file upload) remain intuitive on smaller screens.

4. Components & Patterns
1.	File Upload
a.	Drag-and-drop area with a clear drop zone.
b.	Progress bar or spinner to indicate file processing.
c.	Consistent messaging for success/failure states.
2.	Tables & Lists
a.	Use the same table component for data display.
b.	Standardize column headers, row spacing, hover or zebra striping if helpful for readability.
3.	Dashboards & Cards
a.	Summaries should be in card layouts, each showing a key metric (e.g., total uploads, trending issues).
b.	Maintain consistent card styles (same corner radius, box-shadow, padding).
4.	Forms & Modals
a.	Align fields and labels properly (top-label or left-label, just pick one and stick to it).
b.	Keep modals minimal and focused; always provide clear actions (e.g., “Save”/”Cancel”).
5.	Buttons
a.	Primary (solid background in the brand’s primary color).
b.	Secondary (outline or lighter background).
c.	Disabled (lower opacity, cursor set to not-allowed).

5. Accessibility
1.	Color Contrast
a.	Ensure text color sufficiently contrasts with the background (WCAG AA at minimum).
2.	Keyboard Navigation
a.	All interactive elements should be reachable via the Tab key.
b.	Focus states are clearly visible.
3.	ARIA Labels
a.	For icons or non-text buttons, use aria-label attributes to describe functionality.
4.	Semantic HTML
a.	Use headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) in order.
b.	Keep forms labeled with <label> tags.

6. Code Structure & Conventions
1.	Folder Structure
src/
  components/
    Button/
    Card/
    Table/
    ...
  pages/
    Dashboard/
    Uploads/
    Settings/
    ...
  hooks/
  utils/
  ...

•	components: Reusable, small, generic components.
•	pages: Page-level components that bring multiple UI pieces together.
•	hooks: Custom React hooks for logic reuse.
•	utils: Helper functions (date formatting, etc.).

2.	Styling
a.	If using Material UI, prefer the theme approach (global theme object) for colors, typography, spacing.
b.	If not, consider CSS Modules or styled-components for scoping styles.
3.	Code Linting
a.	Use ESLint (with a recommended or corporate config) and Prettier for consistent formatting.
b.	Ensure all code merges pass lint checks.
4.	Version Control
a.	Git: Use short, descriptive branch names (feature/upload-flow, fix/table-bug)
b.	Merge via Pull Requests (PRs) with code reviews for quality control.

7. Testing
1.	Unit Tests
a.	Use a framework like Jest + React Testing Library.
b.	Focus on critical UI components (file upload, dashboards, forms).
2.	Integration/End-to-End Tests
a.	Consider Cypress or Playwright for testing key user flows (upload file → process → see dashboard update).

8. Performance Considerations
1.	Optimization
a.	Lazy load heavy components (charts, large libraries) so initial page load is faster.
2.	Caching
a.	Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., repeated queries for the same analytics).
3.	Asset Management
a.	Compress images, minify CSS/JS, ensure build pipeline does tree-shaking.

9. Iteration & Rollouts
1.	Feature Flags
a.	Optional approach: enable or disable new features for certain user roles or test groups.
2.	Release Cycles
a.	Deploy smaller updates frequently to get feedback.
b.	Use staging/production environments to test changes before live rollout.

10. Summary
By following these guidelines—consistent color use, typography, components, and accessibility best practices—URSULA’s frontend remains cohesive and easy to navigate. This consistency not only helps brand recognition but also makes development faster and more predictable as the app grows.
